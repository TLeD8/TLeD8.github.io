								<h2><b>Identity</b></h2>
								<p>
									Identities are complex structures that are influenced all the things you experience. New media is showing to have a larger impact on identity than before through the popularity of social media. The younger generation are using social media as a way to construct any identity they can imagine. How people view them, and how they view themselves, is being heavily influenced by there social media use. Identity formation for new generations will be very different from how older generations formed their identities.<br>
									Media theorists stance on new media influencing identity is  new media does not have a simple or direct effect on its audience. He argues that identities are too complex to definitively say that new media is having a straightforward impact.<br>
									It's difficult to say whether new media is a factor in the identity formation of society as a whole. I believe the full impact from new media will be observed in younger generations. Being able to freely contruct a digital identity that is tied to your real identity will be an interesting change for the future.
								</p>
								<h2>Social Capital</h2>
								<p>
									Social capital is anything that exists in the realm of relationships that has benefits in the real world. The social networks that an individual has influence many things about that person, such as income, job satisfaction and mental health. Social media introduced popularity as a form of social capital and its value continues to skyrocket. The vast network of people you interact with on social media is unlike the smaller real world social networks.<br>
									The more valuable that popularity becomes on social media, the more problematic social media becomes for the environment. And not just the environment, it also affects teenagers mental health. The more a value a person places on social media popularity the more likely that individual displays depressive symptoms and reduced physical activity (CNN, 2017).
								</p>
								<h2>Digital Divide</h2>
								<p>
									Cyber bullying is more prevalent than ever and its excluding people from fully utilizing social media. Social media can be a great thing when its used for good causes like spreading envrionmental awareness. A study posted on <i>Brazilian Business Review</i> surveyed people in order to quantify a persons level of environmental awareness in comparison to their social awareness. The less social awareness someone had, the less envrionmental awareness they also had. This is comparable to how cyber bullying on social media is seperating people from utilizing social for good causes. The less interest or access someone has to social media, the less interest they have in environmental activism. Giving more people access to the internet and social media is the best way to get people to be more environmentally aware. Everyone should have the right to freely express a message to the world on social media, and the digital divide is preventing that abstract freedom from becoming reality.
